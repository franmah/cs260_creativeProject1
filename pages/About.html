    <h1>Personal Finance</h1>

    <p>
      Throughout my student I have learned the importance of budgeting. 
      With the very little money I earned, I had to make sure I could pay for food, rent and save for my student loan and tuition.
      For a long time my bank account was a mystery to me. I had no idea how much I had, how much it cost to withdraw at the atm...
      After taking my first finance class, I gained interest in personal finance. 
      Personal finance covers many topics such as budgeting, having an emergency fund and saving (investing) for retirement.
      Budgeting is an important part, and OnlineBudget can help you.

    <h1>Why OnlineBudget</h1>
  
    <div class="wob-section">
      <div class="wob-subsection">
        <p>
          When doing a budget you usually plan how much you will spend for different expense categories. This method has some problems.
          What if you reach your budget for groceries, do you stop eating? How do you plan for random events during the month?
          Some answers is that you are supposed to adujst your monthly budget using previous data and save for some unplanned expenses. 
          But it is still difficult to apply.
        </p>
        <p> 
          My method is to keep track of every expense and income you have. OnlineBudget will not let you automatically pull them from your bank.
          You must enter them manually to get a feel of how many transactions you had and how much you spent. It also helps you make sure your account is safe 
          (meaning there were no unwanted transactions).
          For each transaction you can give it a category such as groceries, car, loan, monthly, subscription, fun, fast-food...
          After entering your transactions for the month you can use OnlineBudget to see your monthly statistics. You can easily see where your money went.
          Most importantly you can make sure you earned more than you spent.
        </p>
      </div>

    </div>
    <p class="ending-section">
      The goal is to go through each category and see if you feel comfortable with the amount you spent. 
      Maybe you spent a lot on groceries but it is acceptable to you as you are trying to eat healthy.
      Maybe you spent a lot on fast-food, you find out you ate out this month more than you thought. You could set a goal to go out less often next month.
      The purpose is not to feel bad or judgemental, but to learn and improve. 
      Unlike a normal budget, the most important is to not set restrictions such as a maximum amount for one category, but rather to adjust spending habits.
    </p>
